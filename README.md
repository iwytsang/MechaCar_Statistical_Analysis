Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vehicle Weight.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope is not zero due to the p-value being 5.35 x 10^11
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

Yes it meets the design specifications for all lots. However,, individually, it only fits for Lots 1 & 2. Not for Lot 3
